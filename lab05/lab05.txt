Pods
Lab 5: Stopping and removing pods
=================================

// Deleting a pod by name
$ kubectl delete po kubek-gpu
// - you can also delete more than one pod by specifying multiple, space-sep-
//   arated names (for example, kubectl delete po pod1 pod2)
// - all the containers that are part of that pod are terminated
// - Kubernetes sends a SIGTERM signal to the process and waits a certain
//   number of seconds (30 by default) for it to shut down gracefully
// - if it doesnâ€™t shut down in time, the process is then killed through SIGKILL.
// - to make sure your processes are always shut down gracefully,
//   they need to handle the SIGTERM signal properly.

// Deleting pods using label selectors
$ kubectl get po -L creation_method
$ kubectl delete po -l creation_method=manual

// Deleting pods by deleting the whole namespace
$ kubectl get pods -n kubek-ns
$ kubectl delete ns kubek-ns

// Deleting all pods in a namespace, while keeping the namespace
$ kubectl get pods
$ kubectl delete po --all

// Deleting (almost) all resources in a namespace
$ kubectl delete all --all
// -  certain resources (like Secrets) are preserved and need to be deleted explicitly
